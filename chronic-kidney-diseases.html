                            Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a condition characterized by persistent evidence of kidney
                            damage or the loss of kidney function lasting for more than three months. This ailment is
                            typically irreversible and gradually progresses toward end-stage renal failure,
                            necessitating treatments such as dialysis or kidney transplantation. CKD is categorized into
                            five stages, each reflecting the degree of renal dysfunction. In normal adult individuals,
                            the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), a measure of kidney filtration capacity, is
                            approximately 100 to 120 cubic centimeters per minute.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-secondary">In Stage 5 of CKD, the GFR drops to less than 15 cubic centimeters per
                            minute, indicating end-stage renal failure, which demands renal replacement therapy to
                            sustain life.</p>
                        <p class="text-secondary">
                            Diabetes and hypertension are the most common underlying causes of CKD, accounting for
                            approximately 50% of cases. Early detection can prevent CKD, especially when it stems from
                            diabetes. Competent kidney specialists make it a priority to identify the root causes of
                            kidney diseases, as many of them are entirely treatable. Effective conservative management
                            of CKD can decelerate the disease's progression and enhance the patient's quality of life.
                            <br><br>
                            In some cases, particularly in young patients, high blood pressure may be the sole
                            indication of Chronic Kidney Disease. Surprisingly, roughly 70% of CKD patients remain
                            asymptomatic, often only discovering their condition during routine health checkups.
                            <br><br>

                                        As a first step toward diagnosis of kidney disease, your doctor discusses your
                                        personal and family history with you. Among other things, your doctor might ask
                                        questions about whether you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure, if
                                        you've taken a medication that might affect kidney function, if you've noticed
                                        changes in your urinary habits, and whether you have any family members who have
                                        kidney disease. <br><br>

                                        Next, your doctor performs a physical exam, also checking for signs of problems
                                        with your heart or blood vessels, and conducts a neurological exam. <br><br>

                                        For kidney disease diagnosis, you may also need certain tests and procedures,
                                        such as:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Blood tests. Kidney function tests look for the level of waste products,
                                                such as creatinine and urea, in your blood.</li>
                                            <li>Urine tests. Analyzing a sample of your urine may reveal abnormalities
                                                that point to chronic kidney failure and help identify the cause of
                                                chronic kidney disease.</li>
                                            <li>Imaging tests. Your doctor may use ultrasound to assess your kidneys'
                                                structure and size. Other imaging tests may be used in some cases.</li>
                                            <li>Removing a sample of kidney tissue for testing. Your doctor may
                                                recommend a kidney biopsy to remove a sample of kidney tissue. Kidney
                                                biopsy is often done with local anesthesia using a long, thin needle
                                                that's inserted through your skin and into your kidney. The biopsy
                                                sample is sent to a lab for testing to help determine what's causing
                                                your kidney problem.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>

                                        Depending on the underlying cause, some types of kidney disease can be treated.
                                        Often, though, chronic kidney disease has no cure. <br><br>

                                        Treatment usually consists of measures to help control signs and symptoms,
                                        reduce complications, and slow progression of the disease. If your kidneys
                                        become severely damaged, you may need treatment for end-stage kidney disease.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <strong>Treating the cause</strong> <br><br>

                                        Your doctor will work to slow or control the cause of your kidney disease.
                                        Treatment options vary, depending on the cause. But kidney damage can continue
                                        to worsen even when an underlying condition, such as high blood pressure, has
                                        been controlled. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Treating complications</strong> <br><br>

                                        Kidney disease complications can be controlled to make you more comfortable.
                                        Treatments may include:
                                        <br><br>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>High blood pressure medications. People with kidney disease may
                                                experience worsening high blood pressure. Your doctor may recommend
                                                medications to lower your blood pressure — commonly
                                                angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II
                                                receptor blockers — and to preserve kidney function. High blood pressure
                                                medications can initially decrease kidney function and change
                                                electrolyte levels, so you may need frequent blood tests to monitor your
                                                condition. Your doctor will likely also recommend a water pill
                                                (diuretic) and a low-salt diet.</li>
                                            <li>Medications to lower cholesterol levels. Your doctor may recommend
                                                medications called statins to lower your cholesterol. People with
                                                chronic kidney disease often experience high levels of bad cholesterol,
                                                which can increase the risk of heart disease.</li>
                                            <li>Medications to treat anemia. In certain situations, your doctor may
                                                recommend supplements of the hormone erythropoietin , sometimes with
                                                added iron. Erythropoietin supplements aid in production of more red
                                                blood cells, which may relieve fatigue and weakness associated with
                                                anemia.</li>
                                            <li>Medications to relieve swelling. People with chronic kidney disease may
                                                retain fluids. This can lead to swelling in the legs, as well as high
                                                blood pressure. Medications called diuretics can help maintain the
                                                balance of fluids in your body.</li>
                                            <li>Medications to protect your bones. Your doctor may prescribe calcium and
                                                vitamin D supplements to prevent weak bones and lower your risk of
                                                fracture. You may also take medication known as a phosphate binder to
                                                lower the amount of phosphate in your blood, and protect your blood
                                                vessels from damage by calcium deposits (calcification).</li>
                                            <li>A lower protein diet to minimize waste products in your blood. As your
                                                body processes protein from foods, it creates waste products that your
                                                kidneys must filter from your blood. To reduce the amount of work your
                                                kidneys must do, your doctor may recommend eating less protein. Your
                                                doctor may also ask you to meet with a dietitian who can suggest ways to
                                                lower your protein intake while still eating a healthy diet.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Your doctor may recommend follow-up testing at regular intervals to see whether
                                        your kidney disease remains stable or progresses.

                                        If your kidneys can't keep up with waste and fluid clearance on their own and
                                        you develop complete or near-complete kidney failure, you have end-stage kidney
                                        disease. At that point, you need dialysis or a kidney transplant. <br><br>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Dialysis. Dialysis artificially removes waste products and extra fluid
                                                from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do this. In
                                                hemodialysis, a machine filters waste and excess fluids from your blood.
                                                In peritoneal dialysis, a thin tube (catheter) inserted into your
                                                abdomen fills your abdominal cavity with a dialysis solution that
                                                absorbs waste and excess fluids. After a period of time, the dialysis
                                                solution drains from your body, carrying the waste with it.</li>
                                            <li>Kidney transplant. A kidney transplant involves surgically placing a
                                                healthy kidney from a donor into your body. Transplanted kidneys can
                                                come from deceased or living donors. You'll need to take medications for
                                                the rest of your life to keep your body from rejecting the new organ.
                                                You don't need to be on dialysis to have a kidney transplant.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        For some who choose not to have dialysis or a kidney transplant, a third option
                                        is to treat kidney failure with conservative measures. However, once you have
                                        complete kidney failure, your life expectancy generally would be only a few
                                        months.

                                        your doctor for a referral to a dietitian who can analyze your current diet and
                                        suggest ways to make your diet easier on your kidneys. <br><br>

                                        Depending on your situation, kidney function and overall health, your dietitian
                                        may recommend that you: <br><br>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Avoid products with added salt. Lower the amount of sodium you eat each day by avoiding products with added salt, including many convenience foods, such as frozen dinners, canned soups and fast foods. Other foods with added salt include salty snack foods, canned vegetables, and processed meats and cheeses.</li>
                                            <li>Choose lower potassium foods. Your dietitian may recommend that you choose lower potassium foods at each meal. High-potassium foods include bananas, oranges, potatoes, spinach and tomatoes. Examples of low-potassium foods include apples, cabbage, carrots, green beans, grapes and strawberries. Be aware that many salt substitutes contain potassium, so you generally should avoid them if you have kidney failure.</li>
                                            <li>Limit the amount of protein you eat. Your dietitian will estimate the appropriate number of grams of protein you need each day and make recommendations based on that amount. High-protein foods include lean meats, eggs, milk, cheese and beans. Low-protein foods include vegetables, fruits, breads and cereals.</li>
                                        </ul>
