                            The Kidney Dialysis Centre in Faridabad offers vital services for individuals with
                            kidney-related issues. Within the human body,
                            the kidneys, shaped like beans, serve as essential filtration organs. Their primary function
                            involves the purification of blood,
                            eliminating waste materials, and maintaining a healthy internal balance. This remarkable
                            process ultimately leads to the production
                            of urine, which contains waste, surplus water, and excess electrolytes, and is expelled from
                            the body through the urethra.

                            Consider the kidneys as specialized filters within your body. These remarkable organs play a
                            pivotal role in blood purification.
                            On a daily basis, they process approximately 180 liters of bodily fluids, meticulously
                            sifting through this vast volume.
                            Astonishingly, they retain nearly all of this fluid, releasing only one to two liters as
                            urine.
                        </p>

                            The intricate process of urine formation can be broken down into several crucial steps,
                            namely glomerular filtration,
                            tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. At the core of this system is the nephron,
                            which serves as the fundamental functional unit of the kidneys.
                            Located at the inception of each nephron, the glomerulus is a complex network of capillaries
                            responsible for the initial filtration of blood.

                                Without enough red blood cells you may develop anemia, which will cause you to feel

                            Complete kidney failure occurs when less than 10% of your kidneys are working.
                            Toxins, waste products from foods and body cells, plus extra fluids build up in the blood.
                            If the excess wastes and fluids are not removed, the whole body is affected.

                                        There are several different diseases and conditions that are known causes of
                                        kidney failure. For some people, however, the cause is never known.<br><br>

                                        The most common causes are :<br><br>

                                        Diabetes can damage the small blood vessels (glomeruli) in the kidneys.<br><br>

                                        Hypertension (high blood pressure that is not treated) can also damage the small
                                        blood vessels (glomeruli) in the kidneys. If the high blood pressure continues,
                                        the kidneys may fail.<br><br>

                                        <strong>Other causes</strong><br><br>

                                        Glomerulonephritis is inflammation of the small blood vessels in the kidney.
                                        This disease usually affects both kidneys and causes steady damage. It may be
                                        hereditary.<br><br>

                                        Other diseases such as lupus may also damage the kidneys.<br><br>

                                        A blockage is any condition where urine cannot flow out of the kidney. The
                                        blockage makes it difficult for the kidneys to remove wastes and extra fluids.
                                        Obstructive uropathy is a blockage of urine flow out of the kidney, which may be
                                        caused by kidney stones or a birth defect of the kidney.<br><br>

                                        Infection is the most common disorder of the urinary tract. Cystitis is a
                                        bladder infection. Symptoms include urgent, frequent, painful urination. If not
                                        treated, cystitis may lead to a kidney infection.<br><br>

                                        Pyelonephritis is a kidney infection that may be caused by a kidney birth
                                        defect. Someone who has this infection may or may not feel sick. Possible
                                        symptoms include fever, back pain, and chills.<br><br>

                                        Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a hereditary condition, can lead to kidney
                                        failure. When someone has this disease, cysts grow and damage the kidneys. Then
                                        the kidneys enlarge, and eventually they stop working.

                                        Early on, people may not have any symptoms to tell them that their kidneys are
                                        not working well.<br><br>

                                        That is why regular physical check up, with blood tests and urine tests, are so
                                        important. Test results may show signs of kidney disease even when a patient
                                        feels fine.<br><br>

                                        As the kidney disease progresses, a person may feel sick sometimes. But the
                                        change may be so slow that he or she does not do anything about these feelings.
                                        Symptoms may also be due to another illness or problem.<br><br>

                                        Complete kidney failure, however, causes many changes in the body, and people
                                        feel some stronger symptoms.<br><br>

                                        Symptoms vary from person to person.<br><br>

                                        <strong>Feeling generally sick</strong> <br><br>

                                        When the kidneys begin to fail, waste products will build up in the blood. This
                                        may cause a person to feel generally sick. Symptoms may include fatigue, nausea,
                                        vomiting, loss of appetite, itching, and/or disturbed sleep. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Fluid retention</strong> <br><br>

                                        The kidneys may produce less urine, which may cause extra fluid to build up in
                                        the body. This is called edema. People with this problem may have swollen hands
                                        and ankles. They may gain fluid weight, and/or may be short of breath doing
                                        activities such as walking or climbing a few stairs. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Anemia</strong> <br><br>

                                        The body will not produce as many red blood cells when the kidneys are not
                                        working. This is called anemia. People with anemia may feel weak and tired. A
                                        drug that acts like the body's own hormone, erythropoietin, stimulates the
                                        production of red blood cells. The drug may be used to treat this type of
                                        anemia. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Toxin build up</strong> <br><br>

                                        When the kidneys are not working to clean the blood, waste products called
                                        toxins will build up in the body. This may cause fatigue, loss of appetite, and
                                        may make the person's skin feel itchy. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Other symptoms</strong> <br><br>

                                        Other symptoms may include: <br><br>

                                        If kidney disease has developed, then in the early stages a lot can be done to
                                        prevent further progression of kidney disease. <br><br>

                                        People get very alarmed when they find that their blood urea or Serum creatinine
                                        are elevated or if the protein/albumin excretion in urine is increased.<br><br>

                                            <li>If the patient is a diabetic and hypertensive, then control of diabetes

                                            <li>Acute renal failure can occur due to many reasons e.g. (i) dehydration
                                                following severe gastroenteritis especially in small children and the
                                                elderly. (ii) Blood loss due to injuries or diseases.</li>
                                            <li>Acute Renal Failure (ARF) may be fully reversible if the primary cause
                                                resulting in kidney failure has been adequately treated.</li>
                                            <li>Sometimes Acute renal failure may need support for dialysis. There is a
                                                major misconception that once acute renal failure has set in then the
                                                patient will always need dialysis for the rest of his life. This concept
                                                is very wrong. As I have already mentioned, once the basic cause of
                                                Acute Renal failure has been adequately treated the renal failure can be
                                                fully reversed.</li>
                                            <li>In non-diabetics, if blood urea and serum creatinine are elevated and
                                                kidney size is normal or near normal then we may plan to do a kidney
                                                biopsy. Kidney biopsy is a fairly safe procedure done under local
                                                anesthesia and ultrasound guidance. Once we have the pathology report of
                                                the kidney biopsy and we have the exact diagnosis of kidney diseases
                                                then we may be in a position to provide specific treatment to the
                                                patient and the rising trend of blood urea and serum creatinine may be
                                                reversed.</li>

                                        <strong>Blood and urine tests can tell us how well someone's kidneys are
                                            working.</strong> <br><br>

                                        Our doctor may decide to do blood and urine tests if you are at risk for kidney
                                        failure or kidney disease. For people who have started dialysis to replace the
                                        functions of their kidneys, these tests let their doctors know how well dialysis
                                        is working. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Urine tests</strong> <br><br>

                                        There are two types of urine tests. One type requires a small amount of urine.
                                        It tells a doctor if there is blood, infection, protein, or cells in the urine.
                                        The other type requires collecting all the urine produced for a certain amount
                                        of time, usually 24 hours. This test will show how much urine your kidneys
                                        produce in one day. It also measures how much protein is passed from the kidneys
                                        into the urine in one day. Your doctor will be able to see if your protein
                                        levels are normal. Your doctor may also measure the amount of waste from muscle
                                        cells (called creatinine) or from the protein you eat (called urea) in your
                                        urine to see how well the kidneys are working.

                                        <strong>Blood tests</strong> <br><br>

                                        <strong>Everyone's blood test results are different. They are affected by 3
                                            things</strong> <br><br>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>What the person eats.</li>
                                            <li>How well the person's kidneys are working.</li>
                                            <li>How much urine the person passes and how much waste leaves the body
                                                through the urine.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        Your doctor or nurse will give you your latest blood test results. Different
                                        labs test blood differently, but this section can help explain some of the terms
                                        you will see on your blood tests. <br><br>

                                        Ask your doctor what he or she would consider to be normal results. <br><br>

                                        Some of the levels described can be affected by diet. Someone on dialysis
                                        usually has a renal dietitian and/or a nurse to talk to about what to eat.
                                        <br><br>

                                        Your blood (or the part of your blood called serum) may be tested for several
                                        things including: <br><br>

                                        <strong>Serum Creatinine</strong> <br><br>

                                        Creatinine is a waste product of muscle activity. The kidneys normally filter
                                        out this waste. Blood (serum) levels of creatinine are the most common numbers
                                        used by doctors to determine kidney function. <br><br>

                                        When the kidneys are not working, dialysis helps to remove the extra creatinine.
                                        Dialysis is usually started when creatinine clearance falls to less than 14
                                        milliliters per minute (mL/min).

                                        <strong>For people who still have some kidney function, there are many ways to keep the
                                        kidneys working longer.</strong> <br><br>

                                        We are lucky to live today at a time when dialysis makes living without kidneys
                                        possible. But there is no substitute for the real thing. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Where to begin ?</strong> <br><br>

                                        Visit your doctor regularly. If your doctor finds you are at risk for kidney
                                        disease, or are showing signs of kidney disease, he or she will take several
                                        steps to improve your health. You will have a common goal: to slow progression
                                        of the disease, and to delay dialysis. First, your doctor will want to determine
                                        the cause, and if the cause is reversible. If the cause is an underlying
                                        condition like diabetes or hypertension, your doctor will help you better
                                        control this condition. Lifestyle and diet changes may also be initiated -
                                        dietitians play a significant role in helping patients delay kidney failure.
                                        This kind of intervention, however, may be effective only if the signs of kidney
                                        disease are caught early. <br><br>

                                        Take a good look at your personal priorities in life. Personal health should be
                                        a top priority. Everyday, personal health must come first, whether it is
                                        deciding what to eat, or how late to work. This is especially true for people
                                        who have diabetes or hypertension. These are the top 2 conditions that can lead
                                        to kidney failure. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Other ways to maintain your kidney health include:</strong> <br><br>

                                         <ul>
                                            <li>Visiting your doctor early, and regularly.</li>
                                            <li>Following your doctor's advice.</li>
                                            <li>Maintaining good blood glucose control, if you are diabetic.</li>
                                            <li>Following your doctor's orders to control your blood pressure, if you have high blood pressure.</li>
                                            <li>Learning about symptoms of kidney disease.</li>
                                            <li>Taking prescribed medications.</li>
                                            <li>Taking dietary supplements or vitamins only with the approval of your doctor.</li>
                                            <li>Staying positive</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        For people with early kidney disease, taking these steps may help delay kidney failure. <br><br>

                                        <strong>Remember: managing illness early is much better for your health....</strong> <br><br>

                                        ...and much better for you than waiting until your kidneys have stopped working. When it comes to kidney disease, most patients prefer to have as little change to their lifestyle as possible, and a sense that they have some control over this situation.
